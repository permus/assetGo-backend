# Team Module - Quick Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to quickly verify that all implementations are working correctly.

## ‚úÖ Backend Verification

### 1. Services Created
```bash
# Check if files exist
ls -la app/Services/TeamCacheService.php
ls -la app/Services/TeamAuditService.php
ls -la app/Http/Resources/TeamMemberResource.php
```

### 2. Rate Limiting
```bash
# Check route configuration
php artisan route:list | grep teams
# Should show throttle:30,1 on analytics and statistics routes
```

### 3. Caching
```bash
# Clear cache and test
php artisan cache:clear

# Make a request to analytics endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost/api/teams/analytics

# Check if cache was created
php artisan cache:table  # or check Redis/file cache
```

### 4. Audit Logging
```bash
# Tail the log file
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log

# Create a team member and watch for log entry
# Should see: "Team member created" with all details
```

### 5. Cross-Company Validation
```bash
# Try to create team with invalid role_id (from different company)
# Should return 422 validation error
```

---

## ‚úÖ Frontend Verification

### 1. Toast Service Integration
```typescript
// Check imports in team-list.component.ts
// Should import: import { ToastService } from '../../core/services/toast.service';

// Check constructor
// Should inject: private toastService: ToastService
```

### 2. Toast Notifications
Open the Teams page in browser and:
- [ ] Create a team member ‚Üí See success toast
- [ ] Update a team member ‚Üí See success toast
- [ ] Delete a team member ‚Üí See success toast
- [ ] Cause an error (e.g., duplicate email) ‚Üí See error toast
- [ ] Try form validation ‚Üí See warning toast
- [ ] No console.log/console.error in browser console

---

## ‚úÖ Tests Verification

### 1. Run Unit Tests
```bash
php artisan test tests/Unit/TeamControllerTest.php --filter=TeamControllerTest
```
**Expected**: All 11 tests should pass ‚úÖ

### 2. Run Feature Tests
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/TeamApiTest.php --filter=TeamApiTest
```
**Expected**: All 19 tests should pass ‚úÖ

### 3. Run All Team Tests
```bash
php artisan test --filter=Team
```

---

## ‚úÖ Performance Verification

### 1. Measure Cache Performance
```bash
# First request (no cache)
time curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost/api/teams/analytics

# Second request (cached)
time curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost/api/teams/analytics

# Second request should be ~85% faster
```

### 2. Rate Limiting
```bash
# Run the rate limit test script from TEAM_MODULE_TESTING_GUIDE.md
# Should see 30 successful requests, then 429 errors
```

---

## ‚úÖ Security Verification

### 1. Authentication
```bash
# Request without token should fail
curl http://localhost/api/teams
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

### 2. Cross-Company Isolation
```bash
# Login as Company A user
# Try to access Company B's team member
# Expected: 404 Not Found or empty results
```

### 3. Audit Logs
```bash
# Check that all operations are logged
grep "Team member" storage/logs/laravel.log | tail -20

# Should see entries for:
# - Team member created
# - Team member updated
# - Team member deleted
# - Team member invitation resent
```

---

## ‚úÖ Code Quality Verification

### 1. No Linter Errors
```bash
# Run PHP linter if available
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyze app/Services/Team* app/Http/Controllers/Api/TeamController.php

# Should show: No errors
```

### 2. TypeScript Compilation
```bash
cd assetGo-frontend
npm run build
# Should complete without errors
```

### 3. File Structure
```
app/Services/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TeamCacheService.php ‚úÖ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TeamAuditService.php ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

app/Http/Resources/

## üîß Quick Fixes for Common Issues

### Cache Not Working
```bash
# Clear all caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear

# Check .env
grep CACHE_DRIVER .env
# Should be: file, redis, or memcached (not 'array' or 'null')
```

### Logs Not Appearing
```bash
# Check permissions
chmod -R 775 storage/logs

# Check log level
grep LOG_LEVEL .env
# Should be: debug or info
```

### Rate Limiting Not Working
```bash
# Clear route cache
php artisan route:clear

# Verify routes
php artisan route:list | grep "teams"
```

### Tests Failing
```bash
# Clear test database
php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate --env=testing

# Run seeders if needed
php artisan db:seed --env=testing
```
