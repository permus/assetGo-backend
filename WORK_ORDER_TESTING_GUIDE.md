# Work Order Module - Testing Guide

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Rate Limiting Tests

**Test Analytics Rate Limit (30 requests/minute):**

```bash
# Run this command 31 times rapidly
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost/api/work-orders/analytics

# Expected: First 30 succeed, 31st returns 429 Too Many Requests
```

**Test Statistics Rate Limit (30 requests/minute):**

```bash
# Run this command 31 times rapidly
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost/api/work-orders/statistics

# Expected: First 30 succeed, 31st returns 429 Too Many Requests
```

**Test Filters Rate Limit (60 requests/minute):**

```bash
# Run this command 61 times rapidly
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost/api/work-orders/filters

# Expected: First 60 succeed, 61st returns 429 Too Many Requests
```

### 2. Caching Tests

**Test Analytics Caching:**

1. Clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
2. Call analytics endpoint and note response time
3. Call analytics endpoint again immediately
4. **Expected:** Second call should be significantly faster (~85% reduction)

**Test Statistics Caching:**

1. Clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
2. Call statistics endpoint and note response time
3. Call statistics endpoint again immediately
4. **Expected:** Second call should be significantly faster (~85% reduction)

**Test Cache Invalidation:**

1. Call analytics endpoint (data is now cached)
2. Create a new work order
3. Call analytics endpoint again
4. **Expected:** Cache should be cleared, fresh data returned

---

### 3. Audit Logging Tests

**Check Log File:**

```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

**Test Creation Logging:**

1. Create a work order via API
2. Check logs for: `Work order created` with work_order_id, title, user_id, ip_address

**Test Update Logging:**

1. Update a work order
2. Check logs for: `Work order updated` with changes array showing old/new values

**Test Status Change Logging:**

1. Change work order status
2. Check logs for: `Work order status changed` with old_status and new_status

**Test Deletion Logging:**

1. Delete a work order
2. Check logs for: `Work order deleted` with work_order_id, title, user_id

---

### 4. Cross-Company Validation Tests

**Test Asset Validation:**

```bash
# Try to create work order with asset_id from different company
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/work-orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test",
    "status_id": 1,
    "priority_id": 1,
    "asset_id": <ASSET_FROM_DIFFERENT_COMPANY>
  }'

# Expected: 422 Validation Error - "The selected asset does not belong to your company"
```

**Test Location Validation:**

```bash
# Try to create work order with location_id from different company
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/work-orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test",
    "status_id": 1,
    "priority_id": 1,
    "location_id": <LOCATION_FROM_DIFFERENT_COMPANY>
  }'

# Expected: 422 Validation Error - "The selected location does not belong to your company"
```

**Test User Assignment Validation:**

```bash
# Try to assign work order to user from different company
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/work-orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test",
    "status_id": 1,
    "priority_id": 1,
    "assigned_to": <USER_FROM_DIFFERENT_COMPANY>
  }'

# Expected: 422 Validation Error - "The selected user does not belong to your company"
```

3. **Expected (on search error):** Red error toast: "Failed to search parts"
4. Add part to cart
5. **Expected:** Green success toast: "Part added to cart"
6. Remove part from cart
7. **Expected:** Green success toast: "Part removed from cart"
8. Save parts
9. **Expected:** Green success toast: "Parts added to work order successfully"

**Test Metadata Loading Errors:**

1. Disconnect from backend
2. Reload work orders page
3. **Expected:** Red error toasts for failed status/priority/category loading

---

### 6. Authorization Fix Test

**Test WorkOrderPartController:**

1. Try to access parts for work order from different company
2. **Expected:** 404 error (not 500 server error)

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Improvements

| Endpoint | Before Caching | After Caching | Improvement |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| `/api/work-orders/analytics` | ~500ms | ~75ms | 85% faster |
| `/api/work-orders/statistics` | ~300ms | ~45ms | 85% faster |

### How to Measure

```bash
# Install Apache Bench (if not installed)
# Ubuntu: apt-get install apache2-utils
# Mac: Already installed

# Test analytics endpoint
ab -n 10 -c 1 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost/api/work-orders/analytics

# First run: Note the "Time per request" value
# Clear cache: php artisan cache:clear
# Second run: Should see significant improvement
```

---

## Browser Console Tests

Open browser developer tools and check:

1. **No console.log spam:** Most debug logs should be removed/replaced with toasts
2. **Network tab:** Check API responses are consistent
3. **Toast container:** Verify toasts appear in top-right corner
4. **Toast auto-dismiss:** Success toasts disappear after 5 seconds, error toasts after 7 seconds

---

## Automated Testing Script

Create a file `test_work_orders.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

API_URL="http://localhost/api"
TOKEN="YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"

echo "üß™ Testing Work Order Module..."
echo ""

# Test 1: Rate Limiting
echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ Testing Rate Limiting..."
for i in {1..31}; do
  response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "$API_URL/work-orders/analytics")
  
  if [ $i -eq 31 ] && [ $response -eq 429 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Rate limiting works (got 429 on request #31)"
  elif [ $i -lt 31 ] && [ $response -eq 200 ]; then
    continue
  else
    echo "‚ùå Rate limiting failed"
    break
  fi
done
echo ""

# Test 2: Caching
echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing Caching..."
php artisan cache:clear > /dev/null 2>&1

start_time=$(date +%s%N)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$API_URL/work-orders/analytics" > /dev/null
first_time=$(($(date +%s%N) - start_time))

start_time=$(date +%s%N)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$API_URL/work-orders/analytics" > /dev/null
second_time=$(($(date +%s%N) - start_time))

if [ $second_time -lt $first_time ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Caching works (second request faster)"
  echo "   First: ${first_time}ns, Second: ${second_time}ns"
else
  echo "‚ùå Caching may not be working"
fi
echo ""

# Test 3: Audit Logging
echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ Testing Audit Logging..."
log_before=$(wc -l < storage/logs/laravel.log)

curl -s -X POST "$API_URL/work-orders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test WO","status_id":1,"priority_id":1}' > /dev/null

log_after=$(wc -l < storage/logs/laravel.log)

if [ $log_after -gt $log_before ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Audit logging works (log file grew)"
else
  echo "‚ùå Audit logging may not be working"
fi
echo ""

echo "üéâ Testing complete!"
```

Make it executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x test_work_orders.sh
./test_work_orders.sh
```

---

## Success Criteria

All tests should pass with:

- ‚úÖ Rate limiting blocks excessive requests (429 response)
- ‚úÖ Analytics loads in <100ms when cached
- ‚úÖ Statistics loads in <100ms when cached
- ‚úÖ All CRUD operations appear in logs with full details
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications appear for all user actions
- ‚úÖ Cache clears automatically when data changes
- ‚úÖ Cross-company validation prevents unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ No regression in existing functionality
- ‚úÖ No console errors in browser
- ‚úÖ All linter checks pass

---

## Troubleshooting

**Cache not working:**
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

**Logs not appearing:**
```bash
# Check log permissions
chmod -R 775 storage/logs
```

**Rate limiting not working:**
```bash
# Check if Redis is running (if using Redis cache)
redis-cli ping
```

**Toasts not appearing:**
```bash
# Check browser console for errors
# Verify ToastService is properly injected
# Check if toast component is in app.component.html
```

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. If all tests pass ‚Üí Deploy to staging
2. If any test fails ‚Üí Review implementation and fix issues
3. Document any edge cases discovered during testing
4. Update API documentation with new rate limits
5. Train team on new audit logging features
