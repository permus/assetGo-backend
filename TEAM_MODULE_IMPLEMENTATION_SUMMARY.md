- **Invalidation**: Automatic on create/update/delete operations
- **Key Pattern**: `team_analytics_{company_id}_{days}` and `team_statistics_{company_id}`
- **Common Ranges Cleared**: 7, 14, 30, 60, 90 days

### Audit Logging Format
```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "team_member_id": 123,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role_id": 5,
  "role_name": "Technician",
  "created_by_user_id": 1,
  "created_by_email": "admin@company.com",
  "company_id": 10,
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T12:34:56+00:00"
}
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration
- **Analytics Endpoint**: 30 requests per minute per IP
